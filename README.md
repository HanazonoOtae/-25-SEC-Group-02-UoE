# Comparative Study of Building Integrated PV and Large PV Farm in China and the United Kingdom

This repository contains the final report and related resources of a comparative analysis of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and large-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems in China and the United Kingdom. The report evaluates system performance, economic feasibility, and policy influences using detailed PVsyst simulations.

## 🚩 Project Overview

This project compares two major photovoltaic system types:

- **Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)**: Rooftop-mounted PV systems integrated into building structures.
- **Large-scale PV Farms**: Ground-mounted PV installations designed for large-scale power generation.

## 📌 Contents

- **Introduction**: Background and importance of the PV systems comparison.
- **Solar Resource Assessment**: Analysis and comparison of solar resources in the UK and China.
- **Market and Policy Analysis**: Overview of relevant renewable energy policies and market conditions in both countries.
- **PV System Analysis**: Technical specifications, PVsyst simulation outcomes, and economic assessments for BIPV and large-scale systems.
- **Solar Thermal Applications**: Insights into solar thermal usage and relevant case studies.
- **Discussion**: Comparative insights on PV performance, economics, and policy impacts.
- **Conclusion and Further Studies**: Summary of main findings and recommendations for future research.
